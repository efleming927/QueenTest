# Queens puzzle

## The puzzle
Place 8 queens on a chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other 

## The app
The board has been created in [index.html](/nodebox/index.html) for you. This is essentially the code you had for pixel art but with the background colours set within the html and all the squares given an id from 0 to 63

The javascript has been started [script.js](/nodebox/script.js) At the moment only the column works underneath each queen selected. 

Can you finish the app?
